styles need to be camel case

dishes.map((dish, i) => ({ id: i, title: dish }));

can use url in place of image

<React.Fragment /> allows for components to sit next to eachother (wraper)
    - shorthand <></>

- className instead of class

- array desctructuring: const [, , item] = ["one", "two", "three"]; console.log(item);

- useState to manage local variables

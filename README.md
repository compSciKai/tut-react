# React Essential Training Tutorial

The code in this project was written in conjunction with a [Linkedin Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-essential-training/building-modern-user-interfaces-with-react?u=67553266)

I wanted to learn this framework for a few reasons. One, being my interest in web development. Two, the ability to create reusable components. And three, to hopefully implement this framework into a school project. 

Different components of this tutorial ie. testing, routing, components, were created in separate branches.
